- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheGitJP
- 👀 I’m interested in ... printing, building and make things awesome.  And make awesome things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... how to flash (not in a creepy way)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... any project linked to home automation and to make life easier (buy electronics, print 3D housings, build and be amazed.)
- 📫 How to reach me ... through here I suppose.
